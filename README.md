## Optional challenges

*These challenges are here if you’d like to try a little more work—they are for extra experience and learning. They are completely optional and not graded. Show them to me if you’d like—I’d love to see them.*

1. Figure out how to use [flexbox](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/flow-display/#flexbox) and complete the layout using `display: flex` instead of `float`
2. Using flexbox, make the buttons align along the bottom.
